##  Introduction


In this part of the course, we will present the main steps that are commonly used to process and to analyze RNA-seq cancer sequencing data for detect fusion transcript genes.
This workshop will show you how to launch individual steps of a complete RNA-seq pipeline for detect fusion with some software.
All the softwares are already installed on your virtual machine. If you need assistance please let  me know.

## Software requirements

Software we use need to be installed on recent linux machine. Exist however the possibility to use some virtual container like docker that allow to use this software also in another operative system (OS,Windows).
We concentrate our tutorial on some  software:

- Fusioncather [https://github.com/ndaniel/fusioncatcher]
- **STAR-FUSION** [https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki]
- **JAFFA** [https://github.com/Oshlack/JAFFA/wiki]
- PRADA [http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/PRADA:Overview]
- Defuse [https://bitbucket.org/dranew/defuse]


Some  of this tutorial for the dimension of the machine you have it is not possible to try. 


## Original Setup

The initial structure of your folders should look like this:
```
$ tree tutorial-fusion-transcript-2017/
tutorial-fusion-transcript-2017/
├── RAW.gz
├── README.md
├── Results
│   ├── HCC1395
│   │   ├── chimerascan
│   │   │   └── chimeras.bedpe
│   │   ├── defuse
│   │   │   ├── gene_names.tsv
│   │   │   └── results.filtered.tsv
│   │   └── starfusion
│   │       └── starfusion.fusion_candidates.txt
│   ├── JAFFA
│   │   ├── BT474
│   │   ├── MCF7
│   │   └── Simulazione
│   └── STAR
│       ├── BT474
│       └── Simulazione
└── scripts
    ├── _run_starfusion.sh
    └── _script.jaffa.sh

13 directories, 8 files

```

If you don't have this directory please download this and  execute this commmand:




```{.bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/biomauro/tutorial-fusion-transcript-2017
```
Here you have the basic structure of the data and the way to download all the data you need to start this tutorial.

Not all sofware was possibile to install in your virtual machines so we need to concentrate in two softwares.
In the next months  more information on the other programs are pubblish.

### Sample Information

```
$ java -jar /opt/bvatools-1.6/bvatools-1.6-full.jar readsqc --read1 ../RAW/reads_50x_R1.fq.gz  --read2 ../RAW/reads_50x_R2.fq.gz 


```
